## User Story

Develop an app to create a timed quiz with multiple choice answers covering the basics of javascript.  This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

## Application Requirements 

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

![A user clicks through an interactive coding quiz, then enters initials to save the high score before resetting and starting over.]
